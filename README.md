# Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) Project Readme

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) project. The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model capable of recognizing emotions in spoken language. This readme file provides an overview of the project, its structure, and instructions on how to use and reproduce the results.

## Project Description

Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is the task of automatically recognizing emotions from spoken language. This technology has various applications, including in customer service, mental health monitoring, and human-computer interaction. In this project, we aim to develop a model that can classify the emotional content of spoken sentences into different emotion categories, such as happy, sad, angry, etc.

## Project Structure

The project directory is organized as follows:

- **Data**: This directory contains the dataset used for training and evaluation. Ensure that the dataset is stored here.

- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, and model evaluation.
  - `Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`: Contains data preprocessing steps.
  - `Model_Training.ipynb`: Contains code for training the SER model.
  - `Model_Evaluation.ipynb`: Provides an in-depth analysis of the model's performance.

- **Src**: Python source code for data preprocessing, model building, and utility functions.
  - `data_preprocessing.py`: Contains functions for data preprocessing.
  - `model.py`: Includes code for building and training the SER model.
  - `utils.py`: Utility functions for data loading and other tasks.

- **Results**: This directory stores model evaluation results, including metrics, plots, and saved models.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/speech-emotion-recognition.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd speech-emotion-recognition
   ```

3. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory in the following order:
   - `Data_Preprocessing.ipynb`: Run this notebook to preprocess the data.
   - `Model_Training.ipynb`: Use this notebook to train the SER model.
   - `Model_Evaluation.ipynb`: Analyze the model's performance in this notebook.

## Data Preprocessing

The `Data_Preprocessing.ipynb` notebook contains the code and explanations for data preprocessing steps. This includes audio feature extraction, data augmentation, and label encoding. Make sure to run this notebook before proceeding to model training.

## Model Building

The `Model_Training.ipynb` notebook contains code for training the SER model. You can experiment with different deep learning architectures (e.g., CNN, LSTM, Transformer) and hyperparameters to improve the model's performance.

## Model Evaluation

The `Model_Evaluation.ipynb` notebook provides an in-depth analysis of the model's performance. It includes metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, confusion matrices, and visualizations of emotion recognition results. Use this notebook to assess the model's suitability for the task.

## Deployment

If you plan to deploy the SER model in a real-world application, consider integrating it with a speech recognition system. You can use tools like Flask or FastAPI to create a web service for real-time emotion recognition from spoken input.
